### Install

```
npm install --save slate-auto-replace
```

_You will need to have installed `slate` as a dependency already._

---

### Usage

```js
import AutoReplace from 'slate-auto-replace'
import { Editor } from 'slate'

// Add the plugin to your set of plugins...
const plugins = [
  AutoReplace({
    trigger: 'space',
    before: /^(>)$/,
    transform: (transform, e, data, matches) => {
      return transform.setBlock({ type: 'quote' })
    }
  })
]

// And later pass it into the Slate editor...
<Editor
  ...
  plugins={plugins}
/>
```

Option | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
**`trigger`** | `String` `RegExp` | The trigger to match the inputed character againstâ€”either a character like `a` or a key name like `enter` or `tab`.
**`transform`** | `Function` | A function to apply the desired transform. It will be passed a Slate `Transform` object and the `data` object from the matching event handler.
**`after`** | `RegExp` | An optional regexp that must match the text after the trigger for the replacement to occur. Any capturing groups in the regexp will be deleted from the text content.
**`before`** | `RegExp` | An optional regexp that must match the text before the trigger for the replacement to occur. Any capturing groups in the regexp will be deleted from the text content.
**`ignoreIn`** | `Function` `Array` `String` | An optional block matcher to ignore triggers inside. If passed an array or string it will match by `node.type`.
**`onlyIn`** | `Function` `Array` `String` | An optional block matcher to only replace triggers inside. If passed an array or string it will match by `node.type`.
